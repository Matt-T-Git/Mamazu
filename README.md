## Features

- Mamazu is trying to help you to find your missing friends. By adding the information of our disappeared friend into the system, you can ensure that nearby users are notified.

- With Mamazu, you can mark the location of stray animals that you think need help, and then let users deliver their help to that location.

- Your location will be automatically marked on the registration screen. It is enough for you to inform the users in detail.

- The more detailed information you can write about the location, the users who will go to help will reach the location completely.

- You can see how long you can reach the marked location by Walk or Vehicle.
